# Purpose

This formula is primarily meant to configure a reverse proxy to another service,
but can also be used to configure a very simple webserver pointing at a static directory.

# Dependencies

This formula requires that a fail2ban.nginx formula exists

# Usage

These are jinja macros, so in addition to including nginx in salt, you need to import the macro in jinja.

``` myproxy.sls
include:
  - nginx

{% from "nginx/proxy.sls" import proxy %}
{{ proxy(site='default',
         server='localhost',
         port='12345',
         http='redirect',
         https=True) }}
```
